<img alt="Intro to Tech" src="/images/intro.png" width="100%">

## Program Description

In this eight-week program, learners explore the **command line/terminal** to become more familiar with navigating a computer while building fundamental coding skills via the **Python language**. All learners graduate with these technical skills, an introductory **Github** portfolio, and information about career pathways in technology. No experience is required. Participants will have the opportunity to hear from corporate partners and to engage in conversations with technologists from varied backgrounds. Our program's curriculum is grouped into four modules: **Introduction to Technology and Python**, **Python Fundamentals**, **Debugging and Testing** and **More Developer Tools**. More about each module can be found in the folders labeled **(M#)** above in the repository's tree.

## Learning Outcomes

* Apply a **social-justice perspective** to the design, development and deconstruction of technical solutions.
* Demonstrate understanding of the similarities and differences between different areas and roles within the Tech Industry
* Demonstrate understanding of the terminal/CLI by navigating the filesystem, creating files/folders, and installing packages
* Demonstrate understanding of fundamental python concepts (Data Types, Data Structures, Variables, Operators, Iteration, Functions, Classes, etc ...) through usage in project-based learning
* Demontrate initial understanding of using different file types (JSON, CSV, TXT, etc ...) to generate inputs/outputs using python
* Apply fundamental coding skills to simple development and management requirements
