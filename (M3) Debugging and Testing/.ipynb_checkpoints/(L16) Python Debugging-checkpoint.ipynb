    "We have been talking a good bit about how data and information is used and how those uses affect our daily lives. Now let's talk about how we can take control and begin gathering data and information for ourselves!\n",

    "# Debugging in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some funny history about developers and the experience of debugging; in 1947 the first reported computer bug came a team of computer scientist at Harvard University. The team of computer scientist found that their computer, the Mark II, was giving errors that it hadn't before so they decided to open up the hardware. Once they opened it, they found a moth flying around inside. The trapped insect had disrupted the electronics of the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we aren't fortunate enough to have the bugs we deal with nowadays being so easy to find. So what exactly is a bug and how to we identify it?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **bug** is an error, flaw or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. We learned before that bugs are most commonly associated with **logical errors** and **runtime errors**. The process of identifying and removing bugs from a program is called **debugging**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning and understanding how to debug programs can certainly be a tedious task, but it is a very good skill to have. When you understand debugging it allows you to efficiently respond to any bugs that occur in your own code and it makes you more equipped to avoid those bugs in the first place. It the software industry debugging cost amount up to around $312 billion a year.\n",

    "### Reading Tracebacks and Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to debug code in Python and the other languages, some of which are more advanced tools than others. We will focus on a few of the more old-fashioned approaches like using your tracebacks to understand what your code is trying to say. \n",
    "\n",
    "We talked about **tracebacks** a bit before. If you remember, they are the weird messages that show up in our terminal when we try to run a program and it gives us an error. Each traceback is made up of three parts. Do you remember what they are?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these three parts, if we understaned what each of them is trying to tell us then we can begin to understand what is causing some of the errors in our code. Here's how:\n",

Above that, we can see the line of code that was executed. Next, we discover where this error by reading the file name. The file name is usually one file in your project indicated by \".py\". Next, we look at the line number to discover the specific line of code where the error occurred. And finally, if there is an error with a function call we then would look at the callstack, just to be sure we don't have issues across different functions.<center/></b>"
