## Module Description

During this part of the program, we will focus on learning more about some of the issues you may run into when creating codebases as a developer and how to deal with those issues. This process is referred to as **debugging**. Debugging applications can sometimes be an unwelcome activity. You’re busy working on creating your algorithms and you just want them to work. However, at other times, you might be learning a new language feature or experimenting with a new approach and want to understand more deeply how something is working. Regardless of the situation, debugging code is a necessity and it can help to improve the quality of the code you write. 

We will also learn more about **testing** during this module. Testing your code is very important. Getting used to writing testing code and running this code in parallel is now considered a good habit. This is commonly referred to as **test-driven development**. Used wisely, this method helps to define your code’s intent more precisely and makes it easier for others to interact with your code. When something goes wrong or has to be changed, if your code has a good set of tests then you or other developers will rely largely on the test to fix the problem or modify a given behavior. Therefore the testing code will be read as much as or even more than the running code. Another use of the testing code is as an introduction to new developers. When someone will have to work on the code base, running and reading the related testing code is often the best thing that they can do to start.
