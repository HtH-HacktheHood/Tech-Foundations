    "# Making a List, Checking it Twice\n",
    "\n",
    "During the last lesson, we discussed a type of data known as **sequence data**. Sequences allow you to store multiple values in an organized and efficient manner. Of the sequence data types we've discussed, the most commonly used ones are strings and lists. Strings are a pretty simple data type to understand, although we will discuss a few more details about strings later. Here we want to focus mostly on the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The list, which if you remember from the last lesson, can be written as a list of comma-separated values between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type. Items in a list can be accessed through **indexing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing\n",
    "Indexing in Python is a way to refer the individual items within an iterable by its position. In other words, you can directly access your elements of choice within an iterable and do various operations depending on your needs. In Python, objects are **“zero-indexed”** meaning the **position count starts at zero**. Many other programming languages follow the same pattern. So for example, if there are 5 elements present within a list, then the first element (i.e. the leftmost element) holds the “zeroth” place, followed by the elements in first, second, third, and fourth positions. The list class in python has a **method** (which is just a function used by a specific class) called **index( )** that can be used to find the index number of a given value within a list."

    "\n",
    "**ObjectName[ n ]** <br>n is just an integer number that represents the position of the element we want to access.

We’ve just learned how to use indexing in Lists and Strings to get the specific items of our interest. Although in all our previous cases we’ve used a **positive integer** inside our index operator. Sometimes, if we are interested in the last few elements of a list or maybe we just want to index the list from the opposite end, we can use **negative integers**. However, in negative indexing the last element is represented by -1 and not -0. So to access the last item of our list we used above the syntax would be:\n",
