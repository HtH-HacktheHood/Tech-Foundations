    "### Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operators** are special symbols in Python that carry out some sort of preordained computation. Any expressions including alongside an operator are called **operands**. Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations like **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, etc. The addition operator and the multiplication operator can also be used with strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Operator | Meaning | Example\n",
    "-------- | ------- | -------\n",
    "( + ) | Add two operands | x + y\n",
    "( - ) | Subtract right operand from the left | x - y\n",
    "( * ) | Multiply two operands | x * y\n",
    "( / ) | Divide left operand by the right one (always results into float) | x / y\n",
    "( % ) | Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right | x % y (remainder of x/y)\n",
    "( // ) |Floor division - division that results into whole number adjusted to the left in the number line | x // y\n",
    "( ** ) | Exponent - left operand raised to the power of right | x**y (x to the power y)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"Python Arithmetic\" src=\"../images/arithmetic.png\" img>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The last 3 arithmetic operators may be unfamiliar to you. The **modulus operator** returns the remainder when x is divided by y. The **exponential operator** raises x to the power of y. Finally, the **floor division operator** returns only numbers before a decimal point when x is divided by y. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are a few examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Modulus)** Letâ€™s say **x = 5** and **y = 2** for our example. When dividing 5 by 2: 2 multiplied by itself equals 4 and 5 - 4 = 1. **1 is the remainder when 5 is divided by 2** so if we were to assign a variable a value in our code like this **remainder = 5 % 2** then the **value of 1 would be assigned to the variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Exponent)** Continuing to use **x = 5** and **y = 2** for our example, if we were to assign a variable a value in our code like this **exponent = 5 ** 2** then the **value of 25 would be assigned to the variable**. The exponential operator raises x to the power of y. You often see this notated as x ^ y or X <sup>y</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Floor Division)** Once again using **x = 5** and **y = 2** for our example, if we were to assign a variable a value in our code like this **floor = 5 // 2** then the **value of 2 would be assigned to the variable**. When you divide 5 by 2 the entire answer is 2.5 but the floor division operator only returns numbers that appear before the decimal place.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"Python Comparisons\" src=\"../images/comparison.png\" img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison operators are **used to compare values**. It **returns either True or False** according to the condition. One way that we can ask our computer true or false questions is by creating boolean expression using comparison operators. Comparison operators compare the operand on the left of the operator to the operand on the right of the operator.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"Python Memberships\" src=\"../images/membership.png\" img>\n",
    "\n",
    "**in** and **not in** are the membership operators in Python. They are used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence. In checks if the value on the left is a member of the sequence on the right of the operator. Not in checks if the value on the left is NOT a member of the sequence on the right of the operator. **NOTE:** In a dictionary we can only test for presence of key, not the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical Operators in Python are used to perform logical operations on the values of variables. The value is either true or false. We can figure out the conditions by the result of the truth values. Logical operators are typically used to evaluate whether two or more expressions are true or not true. We can combine different boolean expressions using logical operators. This allows for some deeper complexity within our programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, they can be used to determine if the grade is passing and that the student is registered in the course. If both of these cases are true, then the student will be assigned a grade in the system. Another example would be to determine whether a user is a valid active customer of an online shop based on whether they have store credit or have made a purchase in the past 6 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator | Meaning | Example\n",
    "-------- | ------- | -------\n",
    "and | True if both the operands are true | x and y\n",
    "or | True if either of the operands is true | x or y\n",
    "( ! ) not | True if operand is false (complements the operand) | not x\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"Python Conditionals\" src=\"../images/conditional.png\" img>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of **conditional statements** that can be used to help our programs make decisions: the **if statement**, the **if-else statement** and the **if-elif statement**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"Python Conditional Statements\" src=\"../images/statements.png\" img>\n",
    "\n",
    "if statements are the simplest. They start with the keyword if.  Then, it checks to see if the boolean expression evaluates to True. If True, it executes the code in the code block. If False, it skips over the code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "if-else statements look a lot like if-statements, but we add an else statement at the end. Different from the if statement however, is if the condition evaluates to False, the program runs the code block under the else statement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If-elif statements allow you to include as many conditional if statements  as you want, allowing for multiple checks."
