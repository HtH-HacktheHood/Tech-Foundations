    "\n",
    "Functions are an essential part of the Python programming language: we have already encountered and used some of the many fantastic functions that are built-in in the Python language or that come with its library ecosystem. You've also seen that sometimes you’ll need to write your own functions to solve problems and perform various tasks. You use functions in programming to bundle a set of instructions that you want to use repeatedly or that, because of their complexity, are better self-contained in a sub-program and called when needed. That means that a function is a piece of code written to carry out a specified task. To carry out that specific task, the function might or might not need multiple inputs. When the task is carried out, the function can or can not return one or more values.\n",

    "### Three Python Function Types\n",
    "1. **Built-in functions** ➾ such as the help( ), print( ), and type( ) functions we have used before\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User-Defined Functions** ➾ (UDFs) which are functions that users create to help them out by performing a specific set of instructions. Like the functions you defined for your lists and dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Anonymous functions** ➾ which are also called **lambda functions** because they are not declared with the standard def keyword."

    "### Functions vs Methods\n",
    "A **method** refers to a function which is part of a **class**. You access it with an instance or object of the class. You have seen these being used when we practice with our data structures' classes, using the append method to add things to a list or using the keys method with a dictionary to get a list of all the keys. You can also create your own classes with their own methods, but we will not go over that during our time together. However, a function doesn’t have this restriction: it just refers to a standalone function. This means that all methods are functions, but not all functions are methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters vs Arguments\n",
    "**Parameters** are the names used when defining a function or a method, and into which **arguments** will be mapped. In other words, arguments are the things which are supplied to any function or method call, while the function or method code refers to the arguments by their parameter names.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: let's say that we structured a function as follows."

    "\n",
    "The first argument of every class method is always a reference to the current instance of the class. By convention, this argument is called **self**. This all means that you don’t pass the reference to self in this case because self is the parameter name for an implicitly passed argument that refers to the instance through which a method is being invoked. It gets inserted implicitly into the argument list. Again, since this is specific to classes you don't need to worry about it much right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also thinking about parameters, you can give them default values. This means that if someone using the function does not give an argument for a parameter that has a default value, then the default value will be used. you can assign the default value when you define the function.\n",
