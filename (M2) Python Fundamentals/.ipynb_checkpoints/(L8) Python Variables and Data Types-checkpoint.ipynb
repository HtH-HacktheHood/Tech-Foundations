However, if this were to be a part of an algorithm, we would only have access to the most recent value that was given to a variable.

    "**Be sure that you are using clear and descriptive variable names!** Rather than naming variables x,y,z like we are used to in math and science, we want to use more descriptive names for our variables in programming. When we use the value 22 in our code we want the variable name to reflect what 22 is supposed to represent. For example if 22 represents an age then it would make more sense to initialize our variable something like this: **age = 22**. A variable name should give developers insight about what the variable is related to or used for.\n",

    "A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values used to store data values like a map. Unlike other data types that hold only a single value as an element, dictionaries hold **key:value pairs**. A key-value pair is used in the dictionary to make it more optimized. Each key is mapped to its appropriate value using a colon, and all key:value pairs are seperated by a comma. A dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of pairs within curly {} braces. Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, but all keys must be immutable and unique. A dictionary can also be created by the built-in function **dict( )**. An empty dictionary can be created by just placing it to curly braces{}. Dictionary keys are case sensitive, same name but different cases of Key will be treated distinctly. Example: \"King\" and \"king\" would be treated as unique keys although they are the same word."

    "## Sequence Data\n",
    "In Python, sequence data types are ordered collections of similar or different data types. Sequences allows to store multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion. There are several sequence types in Python are **strings**, **lists** and **tuples**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**String** - Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote. In python there is no character data type, a character is a string of length one. It is represented by **str** class. Strings in Python can be created using single quotes or double quotes or even triple quotes. Individual characters of a string can be accessed by using the method of **indexing**. We will learn more about indexing later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**List** - Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is a ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type. It is represented by **list** class. Lists can be created by just placing the sequence inside the square brackets [ ]. Each value within a list can be accessed by indexing as well or the use of loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuple** - Just like lists, tuples are also an ordered collection of Python objects. The only difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are **immutable** meaning it cannot be modified after it is created. It is represented by **tuple** class. Tuples are created by placing a sequence of values separated by ‘comma’ with or without the use of parentheses for grouping of the data sequence. Tuples can contain any number of elements and of any datatype (like strings, integers, lists, etc.). Tuples can also be created with a single element, but it is a bit tricky. Having one element in the parentheses is not sufficient, there must be a trailing ‘comma’ to make it a tuple. Creation of Python tuple without the use of parentheses is known as **tuple packing**. You can access the individual values in a tuble through indexing as well as a method called **unpacking**."
