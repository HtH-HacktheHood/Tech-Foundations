# Tech Foundations: Intro to Tech and Python

<img alt="Intro to Python" src="../images/python.png" height="342px" width="100%">

## Module Description

During this part of the program, we will focus on learning more about the different aspects of the technology industry and what sorts of tools and resources are used by technology developers. We will also discuss the various types of jobs that can be found in the tech industry and begin studying how technology has impacted not just our society, but societies across the world. Once we have had time to grow comfortable with these concepts and our computer systems, we will set up our computer environments so that we may begin studying the Python programming language more in-depth.

Before we get started however, here's something for you to think about. Learning a new skill is hard, especially something like programming and development. Even professional developers find it hard. We are always learning new things, and deepening our understanding. During this program, we want to get you started along the pathway to understanding. At the end of it all, you will understand more than you do now, and hopefully that will be useful to you. However, this is only the beginning. You can take it as far as you want. And one more thing: even though learning something new can be hard, you can do it! Seriously! If it feels hard, that just means you are making progress, not that you aren’t capable of getting there. Don’t forget this.

## Learning Outcomes

* Demonstrate understanding of various roles in the tech industry by comparing and contrasting different fields within the industry
* Identify what field(s) learners are most interested in pursuing within the tech industry
* Demonstrate understanding of the computer's terminal by navigating the file system and executing commands within the CLI
* Understand what tools are commonly used within the tech industry and be able to install and demonstrate usage of these tools (**integrated development environment**, **object-orient programming language**, etc ...)
